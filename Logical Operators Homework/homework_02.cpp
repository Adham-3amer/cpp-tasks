Write a program that reads 3 integers about the classroom:

Number of boys (nb)

Number of girls (ng)

Number of teachers (nt)

Prepare and print a boolean variable for these cases:

nb greater than 25

ng less than or equal to 30

nb > 20 and nt > 2 or ng > 30 and nt > 4

Either nb < 60 or ng < 70

Neither nb >= 60 nor ng >= 70

nb is 10 more students than ng

Difference between nb and ng is more than 10 or nt > 5

Either nb is 10 more students than ng or ng is 15 more students than nb
